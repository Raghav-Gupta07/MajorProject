# Smart Daily Expense Tracker

📘 About

The Smart Daily Expense Tracker is a simple C program that helps you keep track of how much you’re spending in a day. You just give it a bunch of expenses with their categories and amounts, and it adds everything up for you. It also checks if you stayed under your daily budget or went over it.

The project uses basic C concepts like structures, separate header/source files, and modular code. It’s made to work with input given through standard input, so it fits perfectly with automated testing or running it using redirected input.

📝 Instructions

To use this program, you first compile it and then run it while giving the input through standard input. The program expects:

How many expenses you want to enter

Your daily budget limit

Each expense written as a category followed by an amount

Your input is read directly from standard input, so you run the program with input redirection. After that, the program calculates your total spending and shows you a clean report that tells you whether you're within your budget or not.
